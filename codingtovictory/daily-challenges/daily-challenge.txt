Push code up to Github and create a Pull Request then merge your changes into your main branch
Make sure to check out to main and pull your latest changes
Create Two Feature Branches:
Create two branches from the main branch, named feature-x and feature-y.
Make Overlapping Changes in the Same File:
In feature-x, change the greeting paragraph in merge-challenge.html.
In feature-y, change the same greeting paragraph in merge-challenge.html to something different.
Attempt to Merge:
Try to merge feature-x into feature-y. This will create a conflict in the merge-challenge.html file because both branches modified the same line.
Resolve the Conflict:
Manually edit the merge-challenge.html file in feature-y to resolve the conflict by choosing to keep the text from one branch, blend the changes, or write a completely new version.
Commit the resolved version.
Document the Resolution:
Document the steps you took to resolve the conflict and why you chose the resolution method.
Push Changes:
Push the resolved changes from feature-y to the remote repository.
Open a Pull Request:
Open a pull request from feature-y to the main branch. Request peer reviews.
Review and Finalize the Merge:
Address any feedback from the pull request review, and once approved, merge it into the main branch.
