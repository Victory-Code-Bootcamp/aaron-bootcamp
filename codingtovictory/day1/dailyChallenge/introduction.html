        <p>Hi all, my name is Aaron Dalager, I'm 42 years old. I'm born and raised in the PNW, mainly in the Spokane Washington area. I was home schooled until the age of 13, I taught myself <span title="December 18, 1997 - HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation." style="color: teal">HTML4</span> 
        at the age of 14 and wrote a background story for a gaming community between the ages of 14 and 17 on my personal Angelfire website
        that had it been printed would have been around 50 pages long. </p>
        <p>I came to Victory Boot Camp with the intentions to learn all that I can and re-motivate myself to achieve my goals in life and hopefully find a career in the tech industry. I have a passion for <mark>coding</mark> and <mark>web development</mark>. I'm currently learning <mark>HTML</mark>, <mark>CSS</mark>, and <mark>JavaScript</mark> on my free time. I'm also learning <mark>Python</mark> and on my spare time.
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time, I play a lot of <mark>video games</mark>, and occasionally stream my gaming on <mark>Twitch.tv</mark> under the gamertag <mark>Ungabad</mark>. Ungabad is my Gamertag over multiple platforms and numerous
        games. The gamertag is a play on the Gundabad orcs in JRR Tolkien's literary world of Middle Earth.

                        <summary>Gaming (Table top role playing)</summary>
                        <p>A tabletop role-playing game (typically abbreviated as TTRPG or TRPG), also known as a pen-and-paper role-playing game, is a classification for a role-playing game (RPG) in which the participants describe their characters' actions through speech, and sometimes movements. Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their characterization, and the actions succeed or fail according to a set formal system of rules and guidelines, usually containing Dice-Rolling. Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game" target="_blank" rel="no-referrer"><sup>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</sup></a></p>
